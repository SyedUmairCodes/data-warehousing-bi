# Database History

The development of databases has evolved through several generations, each marked by significant advancements in technology and functionality. The market structure for database software is competitive, with a few dominant players and the growing influence of open-source solutions.

## First Generation (1960s)

These early systems supported sequential and random searching of files. Users were required to write detailed computer programs to access data, and there were few or no standards. These systems are often considered file processing systems rather than true DBMSs, as they managed only one entity type.

## Second Generation (1970s)

These were the first true Database Management Systems (DBMS), capable of managing multiple entity types and relationships. However, access to data still required writing computer programs, and these systems were "navigational," with programmers needing to write code to navigate among linked records. Some products adhered to the CODASYL standard, though IBM, the major computer company at the time, ignored it. IBM supported a hierarchical data model.

## Third Generation (1980s)

This generation is characterized by relational DBMSs, based on mathematical relations and associated operators. Non-procedural languages for database access became prominent, and optimization technology was developed to ensure efficient access. IBM played a key role in the commercialization of relational database technology, and SQL became the widely accepted standard.

## Fourth Generation (1990s-2010s)

This generation has extended database technology to unconventional data types, such as images, videos, maps, and web data, using the Extensible Markup Language (XML) as a publishing standard. These systems are known as object-relational or object-oriented. They also feature data warehouse processing, cloud computing, and support for big data. This generation of databases has incorporated features for business intelligence, data integration, and the use of summarized data.

# Types of Databases and Providers

## Enterprise

Oracle is considered the leading provider of enterprise database products, holding a significant market share. Strong competition comes from IBM, Microsoft, SAP, Teradata, and open source products such as PostgreSQL. Microsoft SQL Server and IBM DB2 are also major players, with market shares shifting over time.

Open source DBMS products have challenged commercial products, especially at the low end of the enterprise market. While source code is available without charge, most organizations purchase support contracts.

> MySQL is a leader in the open source market, with competition from MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB.

## Desktop

Microsoft Access dominates the desktop database market, largely due to the dominance of Microsoft Office. Open source products like LibreOffice Base and OpenOffice Base are also significant in this market.

## Cloud

The cloud database market is rapidly evolving, with most major DBMS vendors offering cloud-based solutions. Some vendors provide both traditional SQL and emerging NoSQL products, such as Amazon Relational Data Service (SQL) and Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL), and Microsoft Azure (SQL) and DocumentDB (NoSQL).
