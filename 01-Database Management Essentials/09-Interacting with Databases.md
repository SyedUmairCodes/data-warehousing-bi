# Interacting with Databases

Different users interact with databases in various ways, depending on their roles and needs within an organization. These interactions can be broadly categorized into those of functional users and information systems professionals.

Functional users interact with databases as part of their daily work, while information systems professionals are involved in the design and implementation of databases.

- Indirect users receive data in a report or spreadsheet but don't directly interact with the database itself.
- Parametric users use database to generate reports and interact with the database using an internal-tool.
- Power users use the DBMS to interact with the database and have enough knowledge about it to run ad-hoc queries using SQL.
- Developers create applications and external views that other users can use for interacting with the database.
- System professionals are the ones who develop and maintain the systems that the database runs on.
- Database admins work with other users and design the database itself, they have detailed knowledge of individual database management systems.
- Data admins are the managers who set data policies and authorize which database will be used.

## Procedural and Non-procedural access

Procedural access is when we use SQL queries to work with the database and write specific queries to return the data from the database. Non-procedural access is when we use an application that automatically retrieves the data from the database for us.
