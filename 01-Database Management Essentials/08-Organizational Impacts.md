# Organizational Impacts

Databases have a significant impact on organizations, influencing their daily operations, decision-making processes, and overall efficiency. They serve as a foundation for managing vital information and supporting various organizational activities.

Databases are crucial for the smooth functioning of daily business activities. They provide essential support for tasks such as taking orders, making reservations, paying employees, managing inventory, and processing transactions.

Databases are not only essential for day-to-day operations but also vital for informed decision-making. They transform raw data into valuable information that can be used to make strategic choices. This includes resolving customer complaints, choosing suppliers, determining pricing levels, and identifying new market opportunities.

Databases provide organizations with reliable, long-term memory for critical data about customers, employees, orders, products, and other vital entities. This memory is crucial for tracking relationships among these entities, such as which customers placed specific orders or which students enrolled in specific courses.

Databases manage and organize large volumes of data that organizations collect, including both conventional data like names and addresses and unconventional data like images and videos. The effective organization of data ensures ease of retrieval and maintenance, and transforms raw data into useful information for decision making.

By establishing a common vocabulary, databases improve communication among different parts of an organization. They provide a uniform approach to data, eliminating multiple formats for addresses, customer identification, and calculations, which can unify an organization.

By providing fast and reliable access to data, databases can improve efficiency and reduce costs by automating many tasks. Non-procedural access, using SQL, can dramatically improve software productivity by reducing the amount of code needed to retrieve information.
